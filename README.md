# M2FISHBOT

An external python Metin2 fishbot.

This fishbot was made by [@vncsms](https://github.com/vncsms/Metin2FishBot)

I fixed some things, changed the UI, and improved code.
This will have regular updates, since, I want to add more useful & safe functions.

The sourcecode will not be available, since is the one from @vncsms.

## How to run?

1. Download the repository.
2. Run fishbot.exe with admin
3. Open METIN2 with 800x800 resolution
4. Put the fishing skill in 1st slot, and the baits in 2nd one.
5. Go to "Fishbot" tab and press start.

That's it.
 
As I said, check @vncsms repository if you get in troubles.
